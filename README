1) There are two external jar dependencies: sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2.jar 
and commons-lang3-3.4.jar

2) To run this project, it is best to use eclipse and import the project 
and run individual windows. It you want to run outside of eclipse, the 
project must be compiled into a single executable jar with the desired 
window set as the launch configuration.
The following windows are:
-ChefWindow (client)
-KioskWindow (client)
-RegisterWindow (client)
-ManagerWindow (client)
-OrderManagement (client)
-PizzaStore (server)
PizzaStore is the server and needs to be run first. Next, run one or any
combination of the clients that you want. In each client, look for 
registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(); in the main method and add in an
address that PizzaStore is running on. 
ex: .getRegistry("filbert.cs.colostate.edu")

3) a username of 'q' and a password of 'q' will work on any login

4) The program has a strong interface design and server-client 
implementation. Nothing is particularly weak or missing from A5, as most
concerns from A4 were addressed.

5) The facade pattern was used in order to implement RMI. The UI and
backend are separated through the controllers in the controller package.
